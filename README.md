Unity code for moving character in 2.5D quest project

Hello all.
This repository holds some examples of controlling character movement in 2.5D quest game. 
I use Guybrush Threepwood animation found at internet, and one of Deponia sketch scenes as a background.

This is my first game project, and this is done 100% for testing and learning. 
So I don't advise any of interested people to use it as a reference. Anyhow, it's up to you, maybe you can find it useful. 

BR, Sergey Spiridovich.
